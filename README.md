# my-shop
It's my first project on GitHub. I am currently working on it.
This project is intended to imitate an online shop. It is connected to a database, which is also in the repository. It searches, sorts and displays specific records depending on the data inserted in the form. <br>
In the "databases" folder there is a database that I created by myself. It is needed for the project to work properly. <br>
In the "images" folder, there are pictures which are on the website. <br>
I created the project by hosting the site on a local host via xampp. <br>
